## 👋 About me

I'm a pretty normal person who got into `Super AI Engineer (SS06)` — and that one door opened into a
whole run of hackathons. I don't come from a deep ML/engineering background; I have the basics and a
stubborn habit of learning. My method is simple: pick something I don't know how to build yet, then
build it anyway — asking questions, reading, and using AI as my study partner and pair-builder until
the thing actually works.

Most of what I build day-to-day lives in private repos — real products and client work. The
open-source projects below are the slice I *can* show; the section after them is the shape of
everything else. 🚀

## 🛠️ Things I've built (open-source)

> Each of these started as something I didn't fully know how to do — then learned by making it.

### 🧭 [Hidden Siam](https://github.com/peetwan/travel_hack_04) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [live demo →](https://travelhack04-copy-3-production.up.railway.app)
A multi-agent AI travel planner for Thailand, built against overtourism. A *Destination Scout* helps
first-time travellers pick a trip from style-only intent, then 8 specialised agents argue, filter,
and route across 91 hand-curated gems + 89 wellness venues with live Thai-web search — and you watch
them work in real time.
`Next.js 16` · `Vercel AI SDK 6` · multi-agent orchestration

### 🗜️ [autofollowdown](https://github.com/peetwan/autofollowdown)
A one-API toolkit for shrinking AI models — `quantization` · `pruning` · `knowledge distillation` —
with a *real* benchmark that measures the actual hit to size, latency, and accuracy. No mocks: every
operation changes real weights, every number is measured. I built it mostly to understand how model
compression really works.
`Python` · CI-tested · MIT

### 🧾 [fahmai-enterprise-data-agent](https://github.com/peetwan/fahmai-enterprise-data-agent)
An agent that answers questions over a messy enterprise database. A deterministic SQL skill-router
handles the known shapes, and a `plan → execute → verify` ReAct agent handles the rest — with
role-based access control + prompt-injection defense, and a full EN/TH study course I wrote while
learning it.
`Python` · `SQLite / DuckDB` · `Qwen3.6-27B` on HPC

### 🔌 [senseflow](https://github.com/peetwan/senseflow) &nbsp;&&nbsp; [gutmagotchi](https://github.com/peetwan/gutmagotchi-stress-companion)
Two edge-AI wellness gadgets on the Arduino `UNO Q`. `senseflow` turns your focus & posture into a
live virtual pet (firmware → Python daemon → dashboard, 110-test suite). `gutmagotchi` detects stress
contactlessly with on-device streaming ML and mirrors it into a Tamagotchi's mood — raw audio never
leaves the board.
`C++ / Arduino` · `Python` · `River` (online ML) · `BLE`

### 🧠 [agOS](https://github.com/peetwan/agOS)
An "agentic OS" that gives the Gemini CLI + Obsidian a permanent memory, a knowledge graph built from
`[[wikilinks]]`, and a logic-first filter that audits answers against my own convictions instead of
just agreeing with me.
`Gemini CLI` · `Obsidian` · personal-knowledge tooling

<summary>📦 &nbsp;More experiments — Kaggle templates, object detection, Jetson edge research…</summary>

<br/>

- [`5DomainsHackathon_Pangpuriye`](https://github.com/peetwan/5DomainsHackathon_Pangpuriye) — Super AI Engineer exam prep: 5 Kaggle problems turned into reusable, beginner-friendly notebook templates (Thai comments throughout).
- [`PangpuriyeT`](https://github.com/peetwan/PangpuriyeT) — an object-detection sandbox (`uv` + PyTorch + torchvision, Faster R-CNN + GradCAM) for learning clean experiment structure.
- [`saie2026-handbook`](https://github.com/peetwan/saie2026-handbook) — a team handbook for Jetson Nano FPS / FPS-per-Watt edge research.
- [`FiarDesignOrderBot`](https://github.com/peetwan/FiarDesignOrderBot) — a LINE bot that reads group-chat orders with Gemini and files them into a CMS.

## 🏗️ What I'm building now (mostly private)

> The open-source repos above are what I *can* show. Most of my actual building happens in private —
> real products and client work. I can't show the products, but here's the shape of it 👇

| Focus area | What I build there |
|---|---|
| 💹 &nbsp;Fintech & trading | Crypto / DeFi portfolio & basket tools, trading dashboards, market-research agents, and signal / prediction experiments. |
| 💬 &nbsp;LINE / LIFF products | Mini-apps & bots for the Thai market — queue & ordering systems and chat-driven workflows wired into AI. |
| 🛍️ &nbsp;Web & e-commerce | Studio and storefront sites, product catalogs, and automation that turns chat messages into structured orders. |
| 🤖 &nbsp;AI agents & automation | Research agents, CLI / Telegram assistants, and glue that syncs tools (Notion, dashboards) and refreshes data on a schedule. |
| ❤️ &nbsp;Social-impact builds | Hackathon prototypes aimed at real problems for real people. |

<sub>🌙 &nbsp;20+ private repos — this is where most of the late nights actually go.</sub>

## 🗂️ A few case studies (anonymized)

> Real private / client work — names, brands, and products removed; the shape kept.

### 💬 &nbsp;LINE order automation · a local retail business
`Problem` &nbsp; orders were taken by hand in LINE group chats — slow, easy to miss, re-typed by staff.  
`Approach` &nbsp; an LLM-powered LINE bot that parses free-text messages into structured orders and files them into a CMS.  
`Outcome` &nbsp; order capture runs end-to-end; staff stopped copy-pasting and chasing missing details.

### 💹 &nbsp;Crypto / DeFi portfolio cockpit · a trader
`Problem` &nbsp; tracking a basket of positions across venues was manual and reactive.  
`Approach` &nbsp; a dashboard that pulls live positions and surfaces exposure, signals, and risk in one place.  
`Outcome` &nbsp; one glance instead of ten tabs — decisions got faster and calmer.

### 🤖 &nbsp;Always-on research agent · my own workflow
`Problem` &nbsp; daily market + web research and keeping notes/dashboards in sync ate the morning.  
`Approach` &nbsp; AI research agents plus scheduled "glue" that refreshes data and syncs it into Notion / dashboards.  
`Outcome` &nbsp; the research routine now runs itself and lands in one place.

### ❤️ &nbsp;Weekend social-impact build · a hackathon
`Problem` &nbsp; people going through a hard life transition face a scary, jargon-heavy process alone.  
`Approach` &nbsp; an AI assistant that explains the options in plain language and auto-generates the documents they need.  
`Outcome` &nbsp; a working prototype, demoed at the hackathon.

<sub>📈 &nbsp;Hard numbers left out on purpose to protect clients — happy to walk through specifics in a conversation.</sub>

## 🧭 How I learn & build

- 🎯 `Learn by shipping` — if I don't know it yet, I build the thing until I do.
- 🤖 `AI as my study partner` — I ask, learn the *why*, then write it back as ELI5 notes so it sticks.
- 🪶 `KISS` — simple and lightweight beats clever and fragile.
- 🔬 `Real, not mocked` — I'd rather measure it on real hardware than hand-wave a number.
- 🔒 `Privacy-first` — local & on-device wherever I can.
